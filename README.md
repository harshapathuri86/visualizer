# Visualizer

You can view this project at [https://harshapathuri86.github.io/visualizer](https://harshapathuri86.github.io/visualizer)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project contains a visualizer for the following algorithms along with their code highlighted:

- Graph Algorithms:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Prim's Algorithm
  - Breadth First Search
  - Depth First Search

- Binary Tree

- Binary Search

- Sorting Algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Quick Sort3
  - Shell Sort
  - Radix Sort
  - Selection Sort


For graph algorithms, you can add nodes and edges to the graph and visualize the algorithm on the graph. We used [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) to visualize the interactive graphs.
